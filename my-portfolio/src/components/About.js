                    <h5>Hello, My name is Sintayehu Mekonnen. I'm a Front-end and Back-end Web Developer. I love Coding and Design!</h5>
                    <p className="card-text">My starting point for learning computer. I never had the chance to learn and use Computers when I was Hometown. 
                        However, learning Computer and using was my dream.After I came to the USA in 2015, my first decision was joining school. 
                        And recieved my Associate Degree  last of 2018 at Georgia Piedmont Technical College.</p>
                    <p className="card-text">Then, I started teaching myself online for some basic concepts about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                        I became more interested and continue learning using several online resources, 
                        like Udemy my favorite.</p> 
                    <p>After a while, I met a smart, kind, and helpful volunteers at <strong>Friends of Refugee</strong> became my spine to forward my vision. 
                        It was exciting when I created and present my first website, I remember how many days I spent to put an image on my website. 
                        I amazed when I see my work right now. I added more skills and spend time to update myself each days. Thank you for Code The Dream!  
                        gave me this opportunity   to disclose  potencial.</p>
